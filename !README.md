# Team 1 - Intro to SWE project

• Welcome to Team 1’s project repository for SWE 3313, (Introduction to Software Engineering). Our Presentations, Documentation, Source code, and artifacts will be located here and updated as the project continues.


• For our application we are designing an E-Commerce vehicle website In Python using Flask and JSON In order to create a vehicle marketplace. 

• We are excited to show you our process through the different aspects of our software engineering work! Check out the sections below and follow the links for more details. Thank you for taking the time to explore our work!

## Team Assignments 
•To distribute work efficiently for this project, we are dividing our workflow in two different ways. 
- For each of the main three project Sprints (UI, Technology, Implementation), we have delegated a lead programmer for each sprint. We will all share the workload for each sprint. The lead programmer will focus on laying the foundation for each respective sprint.
- Additionally, we have divided our roles in a general sense throughout all sprints. To ensure proper communication and documentation, each member will deal with future expectations, current performance, backlogging, and feedback.

• Click [here](TeamAssignments.md) for a detailed breakdown of each of the team member's roles.

## Technology Selection
To build our application, we will be coding in Python using Flask. We will use a JSON database to store user and item attributes.

# Project Requirements

In this section of the document, we will specify every requirement that we seek to meet during the duration of the project. All specific features, logic, and use cases will be presented here. These requirements have been selected based on our scope, taking the requests made in the client's elicitation.

You may go to the Video Presentations section of the document to find the presentation related to the Project Requirements, as well as all future presentations.
